    <p>
      I am a sculptor and restorer from Belgrade, Serbia, with a degree in sculpture and restoration. 
      My work spans from classical restoration of historical architecture to contemporary sculptural and design projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years I have worked on monumental and detailed projects, from repairing damaged ornaments and stone figures to creating conceptual forms in metal, clay, and composite materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach is rooted in craftsmanship, precision, and curiosity for material. 
      I enjoy working at the intersection of art and construction, where creativity meets technical logic.
